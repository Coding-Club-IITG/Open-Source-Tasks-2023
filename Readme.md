Greetings to the Coding club"s Intelligent and Elite members.
My name is Krashna. , rollnumber = 220101060 , CSE department .
I  always prefer work in a team rather tha n working as individual.I bellieve that Individuality lead to completion of work with some errors but working as a team gives you courage , motivation and success with no complications.
I wish  to work as a team member in coding club.s
I am going to give the answer of the answer why I want to contibute  to opensource
An opensource-source project is software thaat anyone canuse , modify ,study and distribute.I gives us access to work on different parts of our project in a distributive way as a team with no complications.
Also It gives opportunity to collobrate with other developers as well.
From these statements opensource is a great resource for developers
Every developers should know its working and uses .
Thank You
